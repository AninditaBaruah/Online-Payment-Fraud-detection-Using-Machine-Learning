# Online-Payment-Fraud-detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Task of online payments fraud detection with machine learning using Python.Detecting online payment frauds is one of the applications of data science in finance.

Objective: Develop a system to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data

Key Tasks and Technologies:

1. Data Collection:

   - Download datasets from Kaggle (e.g., "Credit Card Fraud Detection")

2. Data Loading and Database Setup:

   - Use Python to load the dataset and then import it into a SQL database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL)

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

   - Use SQL for initial data cleaning and preprocessing

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Use Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to identify patterns and correlations

5. Model Building:

   - Use Python (Scikit-learn) to build and tune machine learning models for fraud detection

6. Evaluation:

   - Evaluate the models using Python

7. Visualization:

   - Create dashboards in Power BI to monitor fraudulent transaction patterns and model performance

8. Reporting:

   - Summarize key findings and recommendations in Excel

Steps to Implement:

1. Download datasets and load them into a SQL database using Python

2. Perform data cleaning using SQL

3. Conduct EDA and build models using Python

4. Visualize data and results in Power BI

5. Document and summarize findings in Excel
